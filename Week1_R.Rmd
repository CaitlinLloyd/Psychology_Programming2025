## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Load required packages
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
#library(scale)

# Load the nutrient data
foods <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CaitlinLloyd/Psychology_Programming2025/refs/heads/main/Data/nutrient_info.csv")

# Standardize relevant nutrients

```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# Preview
head(simulated_data)
```

```{r}
#Now access the food column (hint, use $)

#And the RT
```


```{r}
#Remove missing values
simulated_data_complete <- simulated_data[complete.cases(simulated_data),]
```


```{r}
simulated_data_complete <- subset(simulated_data,!is.na(simulated_data$choice))
```


```{r}
#Summarize health for one person
# Filter for one participant (e.g., participant 1)
participant_1_data <- simulated_data %>% filter(participant == 1)

# Summary statistics for health rating
mean(participant_1_data$health_rating)

#print this value

print(paste0("the average health rating for participant one is: ",mean(participant_1_data$health_rating)))
```
```{r}
#Now lets merge the rating file with the info file
simulated_data_complete <- merge(simulated_data_complete,foods,by.x="stimulus",by.y="stimulus")

```
```{r}
#now lets group by fat content and summarize for each participant
summary <- simulated_data_complete %>% dplyr::group_by(participant,HI_LO_fat) %>% summarize_at(c('choice',"reaction_time"),c(mean))

#replace the 0 1 values with high and low fat
summary$HI_LO_fat <- ifelse(summary$HI_LO_fat==0,"low","high")

# what are other ways we can do this?
```

```{r}
#pivot summary frame to wide
#now lets group by fat content and summarize for each participant
wide <- summary  %>% pivot_wider(1,names_from = "HI_LO_fat",values_from = c("choice","reaction_time"))

# let's compare the average choice ratings for each participant for high and low-fat foods

t.test(wide$choice_low,wide$choice_high)

```
```{r}
# Here try and simulate a different dataset - a monetary choice task where the participant
# selects between an immediate vs delayed reward. Compare the RT between when the participant chooses the immediate vs delayed option
```


```{r}
#Now load in a dataset we created
dd <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CaitlinLloyd/Psychology_Programming2025/refs/heads/main/Data/DelayDisc_example.csv")
```


```{r}
#Use if statements to figure out which is delayed option
```


```{r}
# Now summarize the RT for each person when they chose delayed vs chose sooner reward
```

```{r}
## Here calculate the average earnings per person (average value of choices across participants) and the number of times they chose delayed vs sooner (you will need group_by and count functions)
